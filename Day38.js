//* Programming Challenge: Number of Days Between Two Dates
//? Write a function calculateDaysBetweenDates that calculates the number of days between two dates. The dates will be provided in the format "yYYY-MM-DD".
// Hint
        // 24 = hour 60 = hours 60 = minutes 1000 = mili seconds
// Days= 24*60*60*1000

const calculateDaysBetweenDates = (d1, d2) => {
    let date1 = new Date(d1);
    let date2 = new Date(d2);
    let diff = Math.abs(date2 - date1);
    console.log(diff);
    return diff / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); 
}

console.log(calculateDaysBetweenDates("2024-01-01", "2024-01-31")); // Output: 30 (correct)
