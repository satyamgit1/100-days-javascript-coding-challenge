let number = 0;  //*- This line declares a variable number and initializes it with the value 0.

console.log(number++); //*- This line prints the current value of number and then increments it by 1. The number++ operation is a post-increment operation, which means it returns the value before it was incremented. So, 0 is printed to the console, and number is incremented to 1.

console.log(++number); //* This line increments the value of number by 1 and then prints it. The ++number operation is a pre-increment operation, which means it increments the value before returning it. So, number is incremented to 2, and 2 is printed to the console.

console.log(number); //* - This line simply prints the current value of number, which is 2.
